To analyze these examples:
After compiling ProteinEvolverABC (if required).

1. Copy the input files of the examples (Settings.txt and multiple sequence alignment) in the working directory (where ProteinEvolverABC_Phase executable files and folders “bin” and “scripts” are located).
OR
1. Copy all the executable material (ProteinEvolverABC_Phase executable files and folders “bin” and “scripts”) into an example directory (where the Settings.txt and alignment files are located), thus that example directory is now the working directory.

2. Run ProteinEvolverABC in the working directory.
